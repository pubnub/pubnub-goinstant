            <p>GoInstant is a service that provided the infrastructure to help build real time applications. They gave you the storage, 
            data synchronization, authorization and security, and a few easy-to-use widgets. With GoInstant closing their operations in
            less than a month, we, here at PubNub decided to migrate some of their widgets to work with PubNub. The PubNub 
            Data Stream Network enables developers to rapidly build realtime apps that scale globally, without worrying about 
            infrastructure!</p>
            <p> I decided to migrate the chat widget, so its a seamless transition for users using GoInstant to power their chat to shift
            to PubNub. Working with PubNub the past few months, I have come to truly appreciate how simple it is to build real time applications
            using PubNub's services. To begin with, we have more than 70 SDKs, so you can choose one that you are most comfortable with. But thats
            just the beginning. Our apis are super easy to use and you can use it for live dashboards and streams, presence, collaboration, 
            second-screen synchronization and machine-to-machine signaling.
            <hr>
            
            <p>The best thing about PubNub is that we provide several simple apis, so you can choose which ones work best for your application.
            This way you have a broad base to start with, and then build on your application to be as specific as you want. This contrasts 
            with GoInstant where they try to incorporate all their features in the app to begin with. So when I got down to the migration, 
            I removed a lot of their features. Using PubNub's JS SDK, I just needed the publish and subscribe apis for the chat application. 
            Can it get any simpler? I dont think so. 
             </p>
             
             <p> With this migration, PubNub is helping you continue your chat services, and develop them by providing you 
             free, open source software, which you can access <a href="https://github.com/pubnub/pubnub-goinstant/tree/master/chat">here</a>. Through this blog, I'll walk you through the steps of the moving from GoInstant to PubNub, with respect to the Chat 
             application. </p>
             <hr>
             
             
             <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>The aim is to build a simple chat
             application using PubNub. HOW? <br>
             At PubNub we use publish and subscribe keys to initialize an instance of PubNub <br></br>
             <pre>var pubnub = PUBNUB.init({
   publish_key: 'demo',
   subscribe_key: 'demo'
});</pre>
	Initialization in GoInstant, on the other hand, requires you to connect to a url using <br></br><pre>goinstant.connect(https://goinstant.net/ACCOUNT/APP)</pre>
             to access and store data for your app.
</p>
             
              <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Once you initialize, a user will be able to choose a username and a chat room(channel)
             and voila - he can chat away to glory with just those two. The username for a 
             user can be set using uuid during initialization.<br></br>
             <pre>var pubnub = PUBNUB.init({
	publish_key   : 'demo',
	subscribe_key : 'demo',
	uuid : username
	})</pre></p><br></br>
             
             
              <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>I did away with all the authentication required for using the GoInstant chat application.
             This can be easily added to your simple chat using PAM(PubNub Access Manager) which provides 
             fine grain Publish and Subscribe permissions down to person, device or channel if needed. Sending and receiving messages
             can be done using 'pubnub.publish() and pubnub.subscribe() as shown below:
             
              <pre> // Send chat messages
    pubnub.bind( 'keyup', input, function(e) {
        (e.keyCode || e.charCode) === 13 && pubnub.publish({
            channel : 'chatchannel',
            message : 'Hey'
        });
     });   

// Listening for messages from other users
pubnub.subscribe({
	channel : 'chatchannel',
	message : console.log(message);	
});</pre></p>
              <br></br>
              
             
           
      		 <p>Basically, you need just ten lines of code to build a <a href="http://www.pubnub.com/blog/build-real-time-chat-10-lines-code/">chat application</a> with PubNub. Different services like login, logout and authentication
      		 can then be added to it based on your requirements. I am sure all of you GoInstant users will find this transition from
      		 GoInstant to PubNub super simple and seamless. PubNub just made your life much awesome.
