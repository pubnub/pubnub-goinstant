# Migrating from GoInstant to PubNub

## Drop in SDK

If your publish and subscribe functionality in Javascript was your primary use of GoInstant, we offer an SDK you can simply drop in to replace your GoInstant library.

## Full Migration

For more complex applications, we've written a full migration guide which you can find in migration.md.

## Widgets

If you were a user of GoInstant's chat widget, we offer a widget that is structurally similar but hosted on the PubNub network.
