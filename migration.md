### Comparison

[Go instant connection code]
[PubNub connection code]

### Identifying users

[link to our doc on authentication]

### Joining Multiple Rooms

Rooms are channels.

[their docs on "connecting and joining"]
[our docs for comma seperated / array]

### Promises

We don't support ```.then``` or ```.catch``` but maybe I can write something that does it
